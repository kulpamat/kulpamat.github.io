abstract: Onchocerca is an important genus of vector-borne filarial nematodes that infect both humans and animals worldwide. Many Onchocerca spp., most of medical and veterinary health relevance, are the focus of a variety of diagnostic and molecular research. However, despite the importance of these parasites, there is growing evidence of previously unexplored genetic diversity of these nematodes, particularly among wild ungulate hosts in North America. These understudied parasites prevent us from comprehending the evolutionary history of the genus Onchocerca, monitoring potential One Health threats, and improving our filarioid diagnostic capabilities. In order to fill these knowledge gaps, we identified five uncharacterized Onchocerca lineages and compared them with other well-known filarioid species using single and concatenated gene regions.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Characterizing five previosly unknown Onchocerca species from wild North American ungulates and evauluating their evolutionary history and historical biogeography.
